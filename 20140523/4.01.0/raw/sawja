WHAT'S NEXT: the following packages need to be compiled and installed:
    ptrees
In short, you will need to execute the following commands:
   make ptrees && sudo make installptrees
Once the packages have been installed, rerun your configure.sh command
to update the Javalib Makefiles.

More details can be found in the installation documentation (INSTALL
or http://javalib.gforge.inria.fr/javalib-doc.html).
