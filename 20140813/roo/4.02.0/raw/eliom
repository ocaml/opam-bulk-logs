About the OCAML core installation:
    Standard library:      /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/lib/ocaml
    Binaries:              /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/bin
    Manual pages:          /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/man
    Multi-threading type:  posix
The directory of site-specific packages will be
    site-lib:              /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/lib
The configuration file is written to:
    findlib config file:   /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/lib/findlib.conf
Software will be installed:
    Libraries:             in <site-lib>/findlib
    Binaries:              /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/bin
    Manual pages:          /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/man
    topfind script:        /home/opam/.opam/4.02.0+trunk/lib/ocaml
Toolbox:                   no
Link custom runtime:       yes
Need bytes compatibility:  no

Configuration has been written to Makefile.config

You can now do 'make all', and optionally 'make opt', to build ocamlfind.
