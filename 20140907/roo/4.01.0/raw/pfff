=-=- Installing packages =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Building pfff.0.27.3:
  ./configure --novisual --nocmt --nobytecode
  make depend
  make
  make opt
  make install-findlib
Checking your configuration.

OCaml (the wonderful language) is present.
make (gnu version) is present.

pfff target prefix: /usr/local (you can use --prefix to override it)
Generating Makefile.config (VISUAL=0, BYTECODE=0, CMT=0) (see also configure --help)
Generating commons/features.ml
Generating globals/config_pfff.ml
All seems fine for pfff.

To compile pfff type:
  $ make depend
  $ make 

Then, to test pfff simply type:
  $ ./pfff -dump_php demos/foo.php

If you want to use the analysis framework and code visualization tools
see install.txt or type ./configure --help
